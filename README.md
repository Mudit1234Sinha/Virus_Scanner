# Virus_Scanner

Here I have created a virus scanner that is not an actual AntiVirus, but will mimic it's function

I have created two methods to scan for virus in python files

In the first program it looks at Virus Signatures(Pattern of the virus in Program)

In the Second method is a heuristic method, where we see that whether file size or date have been modified and if it is then it alerts the user
